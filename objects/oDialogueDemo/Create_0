/** 
The point of portraits is to draw a face with moving lips while the text prints, so that it looks like someone's speaking.

Because of the way JSON works, the above portrait tree translates into 3 ds_trees (which is why
there are always at least 3 ds_trees in the demo).

The portrait tree is a global tree of "actors", and their different "emotions".
Each actor is a subtree which contains key-value pairs of emotes with sprite resources (multi-frame images).
Every actor should have the "def" emote. Then you can add whatever you want just
by adding it to the portraitTree, like above. Then when you write the dialogue, you can
change the portrait using these tags:
<i:alice> -- sets speaker to alice
<e:def>   -- sets emotion to default
<e:angry> -- sets emotion to angry

Note - that using "angry" for Bob will result in an error since he doesn't have that 
key/value pair in his tree. And using <e> without a portrait set will result in an error.
